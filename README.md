# IPOPP-docs
This repo houses public documentation for NASA DRL's International Polar Orbiter Processing Package (IPOPP) as maintained by the USF IMaRS group. Helpful raw files are also stored here, but most documentation should be in markdown format in the /docs directory and can be browsed from github directly.
