# IPOPP-docs
This repo & wiki house public documentation for NASA DRL's International Polar Orbiter Processing Package (IPOPP) as maintained by the USF IMaRS group. Raw documents are stored in this repo, but most documentation should be in [the project wiki](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/IPOPP-docs/wiki).
